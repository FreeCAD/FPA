## Founding

Despite FreeCAD having been around since the early 2000s, the FPA was a late addition.
The association was established by a group comprised of both FreeCAD administrators and core developers in November 2021.
The eight founding members were all forum moderators as well as code contributors.

## Structure

After initial deliberation about possible legal structures, it was decided to use an [AISBL] - Association Internationale Sans But Lucratif - an International Nonprofit Association.
