The FPA sponsors various community events, such as FreeCAD days at FOSDEM and North America Meet Up, throughout
the year.  Typically, the FPA pays for facilities and catering and provides limited travel assistance.

Planning and conducting an event requires significant effort and event organizers should be prepared for that.

Some of the items requiring pre-planning are:
    - purpose: why are we gathering?
    - attendees: who, how many?
    - location: colocation with larger events?
    - schedule: conflicts with other events?
    - facility: meeting room, power, projector, pa
    - catering: coffee, etc
    
A local host is a real asset in finding appropriate facililities and amenities.
