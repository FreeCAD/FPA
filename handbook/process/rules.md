### Administrative body mandate duration

Members can be elected to be part of the administrative body anytime, by two thirds of valid member votes. Each individual administrative body  member mandate has a duration of two years from the date they are  elected. The mandate of administrative body members can be terminated  anytime by the member or by a simple majority of valid member votes.

### Call for members to re-confirm
The chair or any other member of the administrative body may call for ALL members of the FPA to re-confirm their intention to participate.

When a reconfirmation is called, the administrative team will make all reasonable efforts to contact every current FPA member and make them aware of the re-confirmation call.
A reconfirmation period will last at least 14 days to give members time to respond.
Once a reconfirmation has been called, each member must respond to the chairperson, another member of the administrative body, or post publicly to an FPA discussion and state that they wish to remain active.
Members who do not respond to the re-confirmation request will be moved to INACTIVE status.
