The FPA can, if required by a contributor, assume the copyright over a contribution made by that contributor.

By that action, the FPA will become the legal author of the code that is part of that contribution, and the contributor loses his right to be recognized legally as the author of that code. The FPA will also become legally responsible for that code.

Any contributor thinking their contribution might be specific enough or touching domains where some commercial software specialize, and therefore might be seen as patent infringing, might choose to hand their copyright over to the FPA. This allows the FPA to claim they are the sole legal responsible for any harm this file might have caused, and deflect patent-infringing threats over itself. The FPA being seated in the European Union, where [software patents do not apply](https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a52.html), it is automatically protected from such threats.

It should be kept in mind that the FreeCAD code being written by many people and the copyrights over the code belonging to a large community of individuals is a healthy thing, as it makes any takeover attempt close to impossible.

### Handing copyright over to the FPA

Should a contributor decide to transfer their copyright to the FPA, the method to follow is simple, and no approval needs to be obtained from the FPA. It can be done with a simple pull request. The only needed action is to amend the copyright line found in every file's copyright header. For example:

```
Copyright (c) 2004 John Doe <john@doe.com>
```

Becomes:

```
Copyright (c) 2004 The FreeCAD project association <fpa@freecad.org>
```

The contributor will still be shown as the author of that contribution in the Git history. However, the above copyright line has legal value, and would prevail in a legal claim.
