# Sponsorship Requests from Teams and Organizations

The FreeCAD Project Association occasionally receives requests from teams (e.g., robotics clubs, engineering student groups, or other academic project teams) seeking sponsorship to attend events, competitions, or related activities. While we welcome opportunities to support communities using FreeCAD, the following criteria must be met for sponsorship consideration:

1. **Clear and Tangible Benefit to FreeCAD**  
    Sponsorship will only be provided where there is a demonstrable benefit to the FreeCAD project and community. General visibility, such as placing the FreeCAD logo on a banner or event listing, is not sufficient.

2. **Expected Contributions**  
    Applicants must propose concrete deliverables that highlight their use of FreeCAD and contribute to the project’s visibility or knowledge base. Examples include, but are not limited to:

   * A series of blog posts or articles describing their design process with FreeCAD.  
   * Tutorials, walkthroughs, or demonstrations of how FreeCAD was applied to their project.  
   * Recorded presentations, videos, or educational content shared under open-access terms.

3. **Alignment with Community Values**  
    Sponsored projects should demonstrate an educational or community-building purpose, align with FreeCAD’s open-source principles, and be suitable for sharing with the wider FreeCAD user base.

4. **Sponsorship Scope**  
    The form and amount of sponsorship will be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on available resources and the potential value of the contributions to the FreeCAD community.

5. **Application Process**  
    Requests must include a clear proposal outlining:

   * The event or activity to be sponsored.  
   * The planned deliverables and timeline.  
   * The expected benefit to FreeCAD.  
      Proposals without specific, measurable contributions will not be considered.
