# BountySource Payouts

**Note: BountySource ceased operations in 2023.**

The standard way of using BountySource funds to meet expenses involves posting and
claiming a "bounty".

The payee is expected to claim the payment on the BountySource web site.  To do this,
the payee must have a BountySource account.

Amounts are paid out from the payee's BountySource account via PayPal, bitcoin or
physical cheque.  Any amounts transferred out of BountySource are subject to a 10%
fee, so this should be factored in to the amount of the bounty.

In addition to the standard process, funds in BountySource can be transferred to the
FPA PayPal account.  These transactions are subject to the 10% fee, so the amount to be
transferred out must be adjusted to cover this fee.


## An example:

John Member incurs $100 in infrastructure expenses on behalf of the FPA. 

An FPA administrator creates a Github issue on the FPA repository.  Then the 
administrator creates a bounty on BountySource referencing the Github issue.  The 
amount of the bounty should be $110. 

An FPA administrator closes the issue on Github.

John then claims the bounty on the BountySource website.

An FPA administrator approves the claim on the BountySource website.

BountySource transfers $110 to John's BountySource account from the FPA BountySource
account.

John requests a cash-out from his BountySource account to his PayPal account.

BountySource transfers $100 to John's PayPal account.


## BountySource and the IRS
BountySource operates under US Internal Revenue Service regulations which may impose limitations
on payment methods and destinations.

Payee must also provide BountySource with full name, email and a physical address.
