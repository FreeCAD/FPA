# Process for posting transactions on BountySource to the FPA accounts.

**Please note: BountySource has ceased operation and we no longer use them as a payment processor.**

Unfortunately, BountySource does not provide a facility for downloading transactions and all transactions must be handled manually.

Note that we are only interested in transactions that affect the balance of the FPA BountySource account.  Bounty posts and claims by bounty hunters are handled by BountySource.

To retrieve information about donations to the FPA BountySource account, log in to your BountySource account, then use the Teams option to get to the FPA account.
The "Backers" tab will list contributions to the FPA account.  Record the data, contributor and amount of new transactions.  These transactions should be posted to **Donations received in USD** with an offsetting entry against **Valeurs disponsible:BountySource**.  All transactions are in USD, so no currency conversion is required.

Withdrawals TDB.
