This handbook is modeled on the [GitLab "handbook first" concept](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/).  It should be the
authoritative record of how the FPA operates. It documents the consensus opinion
of why various rules exist, procedures, tools, expectations, and lessons learned.

In general, if someone asks a question about the FPA, you should be able to answer
with a link to a handbook page.  If the required page doesn't exist, write it! This
document is collaboratively maintained by all active FPA members.

This handbook has several major sections:
