## The Program

In a new initiative aimed at improving the quantity and quality of online writing about FreeCAD, the FreeCAD Project Association is happy to announce that honoraria are now available for article writers on the [FreeCAD blog](https://blog.freecad.org).

- The FPA will allocate $5000/yr to pay for original blog content.
- Content will be selected by the blog editor.
- Author will work with editor to finalize the article for publication.
- Author of selected content will be paid $100 per post.
- The FPA gets a non-exclusive right to publish the content in perpetuity.
- Content author retains copyright and may re-use the article on a personal blog, magazine, etc.
- Blog posts that discuss topics that are visual in nature are generally expected to come with illustrations.
- Published posts will have a byline identifying the author (may use forum handle or another alias)

## Editorial policy

This is a paid gig, so we reserve the right to request changes or decline publishing a submitted post if it doesn't meet our expectations. Here are some common sense guidelines:

- Possible topics: tutorials, overviews of new features, showcases / case studies and interviews, reports from events where FreeCAD was featured prominently.
- Length: while we generally expect at least 700 words in a post, you should strive for great informative content rather than specific number of words.
- Avoid writing fluff: no lengthy introductions or summaries.
- Illustrations: if you discuss features that are visual in nature, provide illustrations.
- AI-written content: we do not accept content written with ChatGPT, Claude, et al.

## How to contact the blog team
