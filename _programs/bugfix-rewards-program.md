# Bugfix Rewards Program



The FreeCAD Project Association (FPA) is introducing an experimental rewards program to thank contributors who improve the reliability and stability of FreeCAD.

The rules are simple: fix 5 confirmed issues from the [FreeCAD GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues) and receive a reward of €250. The initial fund is limited to €5,000 and will be reevaluated by the FPA upon depletion.

Here is how this works.

1. Identify issues that qualify: each one should be in the tracker, with the “Status: Confirmed” tag, marked as either “Type: Bug” or “Type: Regression”.
2. Submit a pull request for each issue and collaborate with maintainers on potential improvements in your patches.
3. Once you have 5 patches merged within the last 12 weeks, create a new issue in the [FPA tracker](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FPA/issues), include links to 5 qualifying GitHub issues you resolved, and provide links to the commits or pull requests where your fixes were merged.
4. The FPA reviews your submission and does the payout.
5. Submit further reward requests, provided each one involves a new set of qualifying fixes.

There are two limitations left to mention:

- Rewards will not be retroactively granted for qualifying PR’s merged before the date of this announcement.
- Rewards will not be awarded if the qualifying issue was caused by the same person who resolved it. If the issue is older than 6 months, this limitation no longer applies.

We are hopeful that this pilot program will be successful, after which we will review the budget and adjust the rules and limitations to ensure fair treatment.

To all contributors: keep being awesome!
