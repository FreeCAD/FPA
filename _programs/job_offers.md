# Job offers

## Foreword

The mission of the [FreeCAD project association](https://fpa.freecad.org) (FPA) is to gather donations and spend that money on behalf of the FreeCAD project and the community. The FPA is not directly responsible for developing FreeCAD. That is the job of the community of developers who are working on FreeCAD. At the FPA, we feel our job is to help developers develop. Therefore, it is important to understand the primary goal of the money gathered by the FPA is to **help FreeCAD developers**. The priority will always be given to existing and active FreeCAD developers.

Therefore, the main funding program developed by the FPA is the [Grants program](FPADF-Announcement). The grants program allows any FreeCAD developer who feels money could help them to do a better job with FreeCAD to request an amount of money to perform a certain task.

Alongside the [Grants program](FPADF-Announcement), the FPA also builds specific programs it wants to pursue, and seeks people interested in obtaining a granto to perform it. Below are the current programs we're seeking interested people for. If you are interested in one of these program, send us an email at fpa@freecad.org . Make sure you read all the requirements below!

## Current job offers

### OpenCASCADE Liaison (Posted 23 Jan 2025)

The FPA is seeking grant applicants to coordinate bug reports and patches with the OpenCASCADE development team.

Key responsibilities:

   * Monitor the FreeCAD Issue tracker and forums for OCCT-related bugs
   * Test issues and develop DRAW-harness equivalents to the FreeCAD issue
   * Submit bugs upstream and coordinate responses with the OCCT team
   * Assist FreeCAD developers in creating Pull Requests to OCCT, assuming copyright and assigning it to the OpenCASCADE project as necessary.
   * Seek, find and maintain contacts within the OCCT development team, and help them and FreeCAD developers to communicate efficiently.

This is an ongoing grant of 500 USD per month, renewable yearly. Developers unfamiliar with the OCCT development process are welcome to apply: it is expected that in the first several months of this grant the grantee will develop familiarity with the DRAW harness and OCCT test and development process. Good familiarity with FreeCAD and the FreeCAD community is required.

Position open until filled. Send resume and cover letter to fpa@freecad.org to apply.


### Addon Ecosystem Coordinator (Posted 23 Jan 2025)

The FPA is seeking grant applicants to coordinate the FreeCAD Addon ecosystem.

Key responsibilities:

  *  Test each addon in the official FreeCAD-Addons repository for compatibility with the current release version of FreeCAD
  *  Score each addon against a rubric for functionality, documentation, integration into FreeCAD, and developer engagement
  *  Work with Addon developers to bring their addons into compatibility, or to transfer the work to another developer
  *  Onboard new Addon developers to the process of getting their addons included in the official repository (e.g. creation of package.xml metadata file, icon, etc.)
  *  Develop better documentation for the entire process of creating a FreeCAD Addon
  *  Work with FreeCAD developers to improve the Addon Manager user experience
  *  Help develop the Addon Manager

This is an ongoing grant of 500 USD per month, renewable yearly. It is expected that over the course of the first six months all existing Addons will receive a score according to a rubric developed as part of this grant. Once all Addons have received their initial evaluation, the grantee will work with developers by submitting issue reports on their project issue trackers, as well as developing documentation about the Addon development and distribution process. It is not required that the recipient be a developer themselves, nor that they become experts in any of the fields the Addons represent. All evaluations will be basic in nature (“Does the Addon launch?”, “Does the Addon crash FreeCAD?”, etc.).

Position open until filled. Send resume and cover letter to fpa@freecad.org to apply.


### Translatable Text Reviewer (Posted 23 Jan 2025)

The texts shown to the user in FreeCAD through the UI are generally suffering of many grammatical problems: Different tenses/forms used in different contexts, or texts that are poorly written or sometimes difficult to understand. 

This is normal given that many programmers are not native English speakers, but since the English form is the base that fuels all other translations, most problems end up propagating into the translations as well. So we need to fix the English texts at the source.

The FPA is therefore seeking grant applicants to monitor, coordinate, normalize, and unify translatable UI strings.

Key responsibilities:

  *  Establish guidelines to orient developers when writing different kinds of texts: What form to use on buttons, what form to use in dialogs, etc.
  *  Verify and fix grammatical errors in all of the FreeCAD texts. Reach to the developers when needed to make sure of the correct meaning
  *  Monitor and reply questions of translators on CrowdIn and on GitHub
  *  Follow-up when translators find problems in the source strings. Make pull requests when needed

The applicant should be a fluent (native level) English speaker, have excellent grammatical and writing skills, and be ready to work tightly with the community of developers and translators.

The FPA is offering a yearly grant of USD 5000, to be divided and scheduled according to a plan to be proposed by the applicant. It is expected that the applicant proposes a scheme that covers monitoring more or less during the whole year, but the work can also be done in more condensed work periods.

Position open until filled. Send resume and cover letter to fpa@freecad.org to apply.
