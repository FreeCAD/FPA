# Open Positions

## Foreword

The mission of the [FreeCAD project association](https://fpa.freecad.org) (FPA) is to gather donations and spend that money on behalf of the FreeCAD project and the community. The FPA is not directly responsible for developing FreeCAD. That is the job of the community of developers who are working on FreeCAD. At the FPA, our responsibility is to help developers develop. Therefore, it is important to understand the primary goal of the money gathered by the FPA is to **help FreeCAD developers**. Funding priority will always be given to existing and active FreeCAD community members.

One of the funding programs developed by the FPA is the [Grants program](FPADF-Announcement.md). The grants program allows any FreeCAD developer who feels money could help them to do a better job with FreeCAD to request an amount of money to perform a certain task.

Alongside the [Grants program](FPADF-Announcement.md), the FPA also sponsors specific positions and tasks designed to help the overall FreeCAD development process. Below are the current open positions. If you are interested in one of these programs, send us an email at fpa@freecad.org. Make sure you read all the requirements below!

## General conditions

The conditions below apply to all job offers:

* The tasks described in the job description above and the conditions below will be be gathered into a contract, to be signed by the candidate.

* The tasks needed to perform the given job are meant to be organised and performed by the candidate in the manner, schedule and time frame that the candidate sees appropriate, from their own location, using their own equipment, and establishing their own schedule and timetable. The FPA will help, but the responsability is of the candidate.

* The candidate is solely responsible for the quality of their work. There is no subordination relationship between the FPA and the candidate.

* This agreement is a strict non-employment agreement. The candidate agrees to the conditions of this agreement as an independent worker. There is no employment relationship between the FPA and the candidate. The candidate is solely responsible for paying all taxes such as revenue taxes incurring from the revenues obtained from this agreement, and for paying all social security contributions needed in the candidate's country, and any other expense needed to perform their work as an independent worker.

* The candidate will be ready at all times to prove their independent worker status by showing documents like proof of payment of revenue taxes or conformity of their situation against social security, if requested by the FPA.

* The candidate will not hold the FPA responsible for any injury or material loss occurring during the execution of the tasks described in this agreement.

* Both the FPA and the candidate can unilaterally terminate this job at any time, for any reason, by simple notification to the other party. The FPA will pay a pro-rated final installment of the payment schedule if work has been done by the candidate after the last payment.

* The source code and technical designs of this job (as well as any documentation and supporting materials officially produced within this job) are to be made openly available to the general public under the [LGPL 2.1+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html) for the code, or [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en) for documentation material, as stated on the [FreeCAD licenses](https://wiki.freecad.org/Licence) page.

* The candidate commits to keep the FreeCAD community up-to-date with progress made within the project at least every month and will maintain a public log.

* All contracts made with the FPA have a termination date, and will need to be renewed if both the candidate and the FPA agree to pursue it for a longer period.

* All taks preformed will always include the documentation of processes and tools used, so that new contractors can take over. The FPA might block the last payment if the work has been unsufficiently documented, until the problem is resolved.

## Payment

* Upon approving a candidate, the FPA and the candidate will agree on a payment schedule. Payments will be done by the FPA according to that schedule, by IBAN bank transfer or PayPal.

* Contractors must issue invoices for work done, and no payment is issued without an individual invoice for the time period being billed for.
