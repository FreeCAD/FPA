# Open Positions

## Foreword

The mission of the [FreeCAD project association](https://fpa.freecad.org) (FPA) is to gather donations and spend that money on behalf of the FreeCAD project and the community. The FPA is not directly responsible for developing FreeCAD. That is the job of the community of developers who are working on FreeCAD. At the FPA, our responsibility is to help developers develop. Therefore, it is important to understand the primary goal of the money gathered by the FPA is to **help FreeCAD developers**. Funding priority will always be given to existing and active FreeCAD community members.

One of the funding programs developed by the FPA is the [Grants program](FPADF-Announcement.md). The grants program allows any FreeCAD developer who feels money could help them to do a better job with FreeCAD to request an amount of money to perform a certain task.

Alongside the [Grants program](FPADF-Announcement.md), the FPA also sponsors specific positions and tasks designed to help the overall FreeCAD development process. Below are the current open positions. If you are interested in one of these programs, send us an email at fpa@freecad.org. Make sure you read all the requirements below!

## Current open positions

### Job offer: Regression Bisect Specialist (Posted 1 September 2025)

The FPA is seeking applicants to help identify and document code regressions in FreeCAD.


Key responsibilities:

* Investigate regression reports from users, developers, and CI tools
* Use git bisect and related tools to identify the commit that introduced a regression
* Reproduce issues locally using scripts, FreeCAD builds, or custom testing environments
* Collaborate with module Maintainers and other developers to understand the context of the regression
* Open well-documented GitHub issues or improve existing issues summarizing the regression cause, offending commit, and relevant discussion
* Contribute to tooling or automation that speeds up regression identification
* Improve the Developer Handbook with guides and tutorials to help others learn the bisecting process

This role requires both technical persistence and emotional intelligence. Since regressions are often the result of well-meaning contributions, the grantee must approach the work with tact and respect—focusing on shared goals and not assigning blame. The ability to give clear, actionable feedback without alienating contributors is essential.

This is a six month trial program grant for 500 euros per month. On successful completion of this period, the program will be considered for an ongoing role. The selected applicant is expected to stay on top of new regression reports and build a backlog of bisected regressions, as well as mentor others to spread this skill throughout the developer community.

Position open until filled. Send resume and cover letter to fpa@freecad.org to apply.

### Job Offer: Competition Coordinator – FreeCAD Modeling Challenge (Posted 11 October 2025)

#### **Desired Qualifications**

* Strong familiarity with FreeCAD and parametric modeling workflows.  
* Proven experience in event coordination, community management, or competition design (online or technical preferred).  
* Excellent communication skills for engaging participants, judges, and sponsors.

* Experience producing or managing online content (video submissions, streaming, etc.) is a plus.  
* A passion for open-source communities and fostering participation.

#### **Benefits of the Role**

* Opportunity to shape a flagship FreeCAD community event.  
* Work directly with the FPA to support FreeCAD development and adoption.  
* Build relationships with FreeCAD users, developers, and potential sponsors.
