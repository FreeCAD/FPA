# Open Positions

## Foreword

The mission of the [FreeCAD project association](https://fpa.freecad.org) (FPA) is to gather donations and spend that money on behalf of the FreeCAD project and the community. The FPA is not directly responsible for developing FreeCAD. That is the job of the community of developers who are working on FreeCAD. At the FPA, we feel our job is to help developers develop. Therefore, it is important to understand the primary goal of the money gathered by the FPA is to **help FreeCAD developers**. The priority will always be given to existing and active FreeCAD developers.

Therefore, the main funding program developed by the FPA is the [Grants program](FPADF-Announcement.md). The grants program allows any FreeCAD developer who feels money could help them to do a better job with FreeCAD to request an amount of money to perform a certain task.

Alongside the [Grants program](FPADF-Announcement.md), the FPA also builds specific programs it wants to pursue, and seeks people interested in obtaining a granto to perform it. Below are the current programs we're seeking interested people for. If you are interested in one of these program, send us an email at fpa@freecad.org . Make sure you read all the requirements below!

* The candidate is solely responsible for the quality of their work. There is no subordination relationship between the FPA and the candidate.

* This agreement is a strict non-employment agreement. The candidate agrees to the conditions of this agreement as an independent worker. There is no employment relationship between the FPA and the candidate.

* The candidate will be ready at all times to prove their independent worker status by showing documents like proof of payment of revenue taxes or conformity of their situation against social security, if requested by the FPA.

* The candidate will not hold the FPA responsible for any injury or material loss occurring during the execution of the tasks described in this agreement.

* The candidate commits to keep the FreeCAD community up-to-date with progress made within the project at least every month and will maintain a public log.

* All contracts made with the FPA have a termination date, and will need to be renewed if both the candidate and the FPA agree to pursue it for a longer period.

* All taks preformed will always include the documentation of processes and tools used, so that new contractors can take over. The FPA might block the last payment if the work has been unsufficiently documented, until the problem is resolved.
