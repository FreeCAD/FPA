## FPA bounties program

Based on a successful [previous experiment](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%3Adart%3A+Bounty%22+) for solving FreeCAD1.0 blocking issues, the [FreeCAD Project Association](https://fpa.freecad.org) (FPA) is setting up a more permanent bounties program to incentive developers to work on some issues seen as important by both the FreeCAD community and the FPA.

With this program, the FPA wishes specially to put more incentive on issues that typically do not attract developers because they are tedious or boring to resolve, but would nonetheless benefit the project.

#### Current bounties

See the current [list of open issues that have bounties attached](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%3Adart%3A+Bounty%22+).

#### The program

The bounties program is composed of the following elements:

* An **annual budget** is voted by the FPA, to be attributed to issue bounties. The FPA also determines an **reference bounty amount**. The budget for year XXXX is of XXXX in total, and the reference bounty amount is of USD 500.

* FreeCAD community members can **indicate issues they see as good candidates for a bounty**. They do so by commenting on the issue and request the issue to be considered for the bounty program.

* FreeCAD maintainers will apply a bounty candidate tag to the issues indicated by the community.

* A **Bounty review committee** will periodically review the issues marked with the bounty candidate tag, and either grant the bounty by the reference amount, or by another amount they feel more adequate, or deny the bounty. In all cases, the justification for their decision will be added to the issue. They will apply a bounty tag to the issue, to help make it more discoverable.

* Once an issue with a bounty tag has been solved and the related PR has been merged, the person who submitted the PR is entitled to claim the bounty. The person must then contact the FPA at fpa@freecad.org and indicate for which issues they claim a bounty. The FPA will verify the claim, and if everything is correct, initiate the payment transaction.

#### The Bounty review committee

The Bounty review committee will be appointed by the FPA and composed of developers and other members of the FreeCAD community with recognized technical skills so they are able to judge if an issue contains enough information, is solvable and would be a good candidate for a bounty.

The criteria used by the committee to judge an issue will include the following:

* If an issue is well formulated, and contains enough information to be solved in an adequate way

* If the issue is unattractive to developers, because it is tedious or not represents an interesting challenge

* If resolving the issue would specially benefit the FreeCAD project

* If the issue resolution seems doable for an amount of time compatible with the reference bounty amount, or if another amount should be proposed

* If allocating a bounty for the issue is a sensible decision given the remaining allocated yearly budget
