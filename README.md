# <img src="images/freecad.svg" style="zoom:50%;" /> FreeCAD project association

The **FreeCAD Project association** (FPA) is an international non-profit association created by FreeCAD administrators and core developers in November 2021 and seated in Belgium. Its goal is to support and protect the [FreeCAD project](https://freecad.org). 

The FreeCAD Project Association is composed of ordinary members, who form the general assembly, and an administrative body,  formed by the chairperson plus any number of other members elected to it. Meetings and votes of the members happen on a dedicated section of the [FreeCAD forum](https://forum.freecad.org).

The management and operating of the association is entirely transparent and publicly accessible. This repository contains all files and reports of the FreeCAD project association:

### Tax deduction

The FPA, although it is a non-profit organization, is not a charity organization. People and companies donating to the FPA are therefore [not entitled to a tax deduction](https://finances.belgium.be/fr/particuliers/avantages_fiscaux/dons) by Belgian law. Each country, however, has its own rules and laws to decide upon what gives their citizen right to tax reduction or not. You are always advised to consult the laws of your own country.

U.S. citizens and companies can however benefit from tax deductions when donating to FreeCAD. For this, you need to choose the **OpenCollective** platform above. OpenCollective is a [501(c)3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization) organization, and provides [tax deductions receipts](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/receipts).

The FPA can anyway always issue a donation receipt. [Mail us](mailto:fpa@freecad.org) with your donation details and we will gladly send you a receipt.
