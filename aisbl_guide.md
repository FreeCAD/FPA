This document contains things to know to create and manage an AISBL (International non-profit association seated in Belgium). We fill information here as we learn it, so don't expect to find here complete, definitive information.

## Reasons to choose the AISBL formula

There are many different forms of non-profit associations and foundations in every country. If one decides to base it in Europe, Belgium is usually [considered as a good place to start a non-profit](http://www.a4id.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/EU-registration-options-for-UK-NGOs-post-Brexit-FINAL-PDF-1.pdf). Belgium allows national non-profit associations (ASBL), international non-profit associations (AISBL), and foundations.

>  As the European institutions have developed, a large number of international associations have chosen to establish themselves in Belgium. So much so that Brussels has become the second centre of international associations at the world level, after Washington. These employ between 20,000 and 30,000 people in our territory. (...) A majority of them (73%) opted for a tailor-made status, that of the AISBL (international non-profit association).  ([source (FR)](https://www.lecho.be/economie-politique/belgique/bruxelles/bruxelles-risque-de-voir-filer-les-asbl-internationales/10012806.html))

The **foundation** supposes founding members willing to invest money to pursue the goal of the foundation. Contrarily, associations don't necessarily need to be based on money or even own or manage money.

The main **non-profit association** (ASBL) form is the standard form for non-profit associations in Belgium. It is easy to create, and needs to follow the same [Code of Societies and Associations](https://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=fr&la=F&cn=2019032309&table_name=loi) (FR) law as companies. However, it is not recognized outside Belgium and must have at least two members residing in Belgium. It doesn't need statuses.

An **International Non-Profit Association** ([Association Internationale Sans But Lucratif](https://justice.belgium.be/fr/themes_et_dossiers/societes_associations_et_fondations/associations/aisbl), or AISBL) is a newer (2002), international version of the standard Non-Profit Association (ASBL) in Belgium, it has the following characteristics:

* The association must have **non-profit purposes and be of international utility**. The purpose as well as the activities it proposes to implement must be written in **statutes**.

* The seat must be located in **Belgium**. But there is no requirement for any of the members to be located in Belgium. In fact it can even work with no member living in Belgium (only a delegate/proxy)

* To become live, the **statutes** which represent the basic principles of the organisation must be written in a **legal act**, performed by a notary. Legal personality will subsequently be granted by royal decree. A new royal decree will be necessary for any subsequent modification of the statutes

* As an association, **members of an AISBL cannot receive any material benefit from the AISBL**. They can be paid/compensated to perform specific tasks (administration, etc) but cannot receive any money for just being a member.

* The law does not require a minimum number of members, but the word "association" assumes that there are at least two members. However, in order to avoid paralysis, it is recommended that the association consists of **at least three people**. The status of members must be regulated in the statutes.

* The AISBL has its own legal personality, independent of that of its members, it has **its own rights and obligations**. Members have limited liability and do not tie their own assets to the fate of the association. They must however still act in good faith, and could still be sued for example for knowingly using their position in the association to make it perform illegal acts.

* The AISBL is usually made up of two organs: the **general management body**, also called "general assembly", and the **administrative body**, which administers the association. The statutes determine the form, composition and mode of operation of the administrative body.

* Even without any capital contribution or commercial operations, the association must comply with a **number of accounting obligations** (see below).

* The AISBL can do **limited commercial operations** (for ex. sell goodies, etc) as long as it solely serves (and is subordinated to) the non-profit purpose and does not generate benefit for its members. Allowing commercial activities must be indicated in the statutes. Engaging in commercial activities also makes the association subject to VAT and taxes.

* As software patents don't exist in Europe, the AISBL **cannot be sued** for possible patent infringements in other countries where such patents exist. It can therefore assume any code that possibly violate patents in another country and therefore protect its real author from threats of lawsuits.

* AISBLS are also recognized outside of Belgium, so it is easier for them to get services and things like bank accounts in other european countries. They are also easy to transfer to another european country.

## Creation

#### Statutes

The statutes must be written by the persons willing to associate.  The notary helps to review the text before turning it into the creation act. They must contain:

* The **name** of the AISBL and the **location** of its head office
* The **purposes** for which it is constituted, and the activities it proposes to implement to achieve these goals
* The conditions and formalities for **admission and departure of members** 
* The **rights and obligations of members**
* The attributions, the method of convening and the mode of decision of the **general management body** (or general assembly) of the AISBL as well as the conditions under which its resolutions are brought to the attention of the members
* The attributions, the method of convocation and the mode of decision of the **administrative body** of the AISBL, the method of appointment, termination of functions and dismissal of the directors, their minimum number, the duration of their mandate, the extent of their powers and the manner of exercising them, as well as the mode of designation of the persons who have the power to bind the association to  third parties and to represent it in acts, actions and in courts.
* The **conditions for modifying** the articles of association, the dissolution and liquidation of the association, and the destination of the AISBL's assets. In the event of dissolution, it must be used for a selfless purpose.

#### Notarial act

Once the statuses are set up, the obtaining of a legal personality of an AISBL is done through a **notarial act**, which must be performed by a Belgian notary.

The AISBL must comply to the [Code of Societies and Associations](https://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=fr&la=F&cn=2019032309&table_name=loi) (FR) which is the main law that regulates associations. The notary who makes the creation act helps making sure it complies to the law. Some notaries will require you to contract an additional lawyer to do this step.

The notary costs to create an AISBL are roughly **2000 EUR** (as of 12/2021). It usually includes everything needed to create the AISBL: the elaboration of the act, the requirement of the royal decree, the publication to the royal gazette and the registering at the crossroads bank.

Apart from the statutes text, all members will need to provide their identity/passport details, and, in case they won't be present physically to the signing the notarial act, **sign a procuration** to one of the members who will sign the notarial act. This step is also done by the notary. All non-Belgian members will through this receive a Belgian identification number (RBis) which is similar to the national number that every Belgian citizen has.

#### Royal decree

The notarial act is reviewed by the interior ministry and in case no objection is done, a royal decree is delivered. This procedure takes around 3 months. The royal decree is the document that gives the association its legal personality.

#### Publication to the official gazette

The text of the notarial act is then published in the national gazette. The association statuses as well as Personal details (name, date of birth and address) of the members are made public, although in a non-searchable (scanned document) form.

#### Register at the crossroads bank

The registering of the association to the [Crossroads bank for entreprises](https://kbopub.economie.fgov.be/kbopub/zoeknummerform.html) gives it an official **entreprise / taxpaying number** (which is also its VAT number if it gets registered to the VAT later on). This number is needed for a lot of things later such as opening a bank account.

#### Bank account

Most banks in Europe are not very keen to open accounts for small non-profits, so it can be difficult to find a bank willing to open an account for a starting AISBL. It is advised to look for associative/cooperative banks, or ask a bank agency where on of the administrators already has a personal account. Banks will need:

* The entreprise number
* The **statutes** text
* Personal details of all **administrators**
* An initial **budget** for the first year
* The **UBO register** (see below)

#### Determining the type of the AISBL

The size of the AISBL determines its accounting obligations:

* The **nano association** does not exceed more than one of the following criteria:     
  * 5 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers on average over the year
  * € 334,500 in revenue excluding VAT (excluding exceptional revenue)
  * € 1,337,500 in total Assets
  * € 1,337,500 in total Debts
* The **micro association** does not exceed more than one of the following criteria:     
  * 10 FTE workers on average over the year
  * € 7,000,000 in turnover excluding VAT (excluding exceptional receipts)
  * € 3,500,000 balance sheet total 3. 
* The **small association** does not exceed more than 1 of the following criteria:
  * 50 FTE workers on average over the year
  * € 9,000,000 in turnover excluding VAT (excluding exceptional receipts)
  * € 4,500,000 balance sheet total
* The **large association**  exceeds more than 1 of the following criteria:
  * 50 FTE workers on average over the year
  * € 9,000,000 in turnover excluding VAT (excluding exceptional receipts)
  * € 4,500,000 balance sheet total

#### General assembly

The association must hold, at least once a year, a general assembly meeting, where, at minimum, the approval of last year's **financial report** and next year's **expenditure budget** must be voted. The way the meeting is organised is determined by the statutes or other internal ruling. There is no mandatory date to perform the meeting, but it must happen once a year and is usually done **before April**.

#### Yearly financial report

Each year, a financial report must be established, giving:

* The detail of all **money earned and spent** by the association over the past year
* All **assets** (money and goods) owned by the association
* All **debts** the association has

The form this report must be made and filed depends on the size of the association determined above:

* nano associations can opt for a **simplified report** which needs to be filed each year to the **Entreprise Court's greffe**.
* micro and small associations must use **double-entry accounting** and submit their report to the **national bank of Belgium**.
* large associations must also use double-entry accounting, use an extended report system and submit it to the national bank of Belgium.

This must be done maximum **one month after the annual general assembly meeting**.

#### Budget

All non-profit organisations are required to draw up a budget each year for the following financial year and have it approved by the General Assembly, no later than **6 months after the end of the year**. The form of your budget can be chosen freely, as it is not determined by legal provisions. It is nevertheless advisable to draw up the budget on the basis of the same diagram as the annual accounts. 

The budget remains internal. Unlike annual accounts, it is not registered with a third party.

#### Tax declaration

Associations must submit each year a [tax declaration](https://finances.belgium.be/fr/asbl/impots_et_tva/declaration-asbl-impot-des-personnes-morales).

The association can be subject to the **legal persons tax** regime, or **societies tax** regime. Basically, it is submitted to the legal persons tax if it does not perform any commercial operation, ans to the societies tax if it engages in commercial operations (ie, it sells goods).

With the legal persons tax regime, an ASBL is in principle **not taxed on the profits made** (for example, the receipts from a spaghetti evening that you organize occasionally to finance the objectives of your ASBL). You therefore do not have to include these profits in the declaration. However, certain other income **must be declared**: 

* real estate income located in Belgium (except income from private rentals, market garden and agricultural rents, rentals to non-profit tenants) or located abroad (unless a double taxation agreement provides for taxation in the country in which the property is located)
* income from movable and capital property (both received and allocated) (a non-profit organization must also pay withholding tax for certain income and therefore complete a declaration for withholding tax 273 or 273A)
* certain capital gains on land located in Belgium or on certain rights in rem on this land
* certain capital gains on buildings located in Belgium or on certain rights in rem on these buildings    
* capital gains on major holdings (sale, exchange, contribution, etc.)
* financial benefits or advantages of any kind (in the context of corruption)
* pensions, lump sums, employer contributions and bonuses
* unjustified costs or benefits of any kind, and corruption
* car expenses up to a portion of the benefit in kin
* the costs of the mobility allowance up to a proportion of the benefit in kind 

You must be able to justify all the income and expenditure of your non-profit organization with supporting documents. Unjustified expenses may possibly be penalized by a maximum tax at the rate of 102%.

The declaration must be submitted **by October 28**.

#### VAT

An AISBL may be subject to VAT if it carries out a regular and independent economic activity (with or without profit) for which **goods are supplied** or **services are performed**. This activity can be main or secondary. When an AISBL does not deliver goods or services for consideration but only receives donations, it is not subject to VAT and does not need to have a VAT identification number.

The association can still, however, perform occasional commercial activities and is not liable for VAT for such (ex. selling pancakes) provided that:     

* the ASBL is exempt from VAT (above)

* the activities are organized with the aim of providing financial support to the non-profit organization     

* the activity is organized by the ASBL and that any contribution is for the benefit of the ASBL only 

Warning: Activities of this kind **cannot occur frequently**, otherwise they will be considered a main activity.

When starting commercial activities, essentially **the selling of goods or services**, the AISBL must register to the VAT. To complete the registration, the following information is needed:

* The yearly income

* The [NACE categorie(s)](https://statbel.fgov.be/sites/default/files/Over_Statbel_FR/Nomenclaturen/NACE-BEL%202008_FR.pdfhttps://statbel.fgov.be/sites/default/files/Over_Statbel_FR/Nomenclaturen/NACE-BEL%202008_FR.pdf) to which the AISBL belongs to

* Which parts of the yearly income fall under [Article 44](https://questionfiscale.be/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Article-44-CTVA.pdf)

After registering to the VAT, the AISBL must:

* File quarterly reports, stating the total amount of operations (in and out) subject to VAT

* File yearly list of VAT clients the AISBL has sold goods or services to

* Retain a VAT of 21% over all sold goods or services, and pay that amount quarterly to the finance administration

#### UBO register

The [UBO register](https://finances.belgium.be/fr/E-services/ubo-register) is an anti-corruption and anti-money-laundry system in Belgium, that keeps track of possible beneficiaries of companies and associations. For non-profit organizations and foundations, the following are considered effective beneficiaries:

* Administrators
* The people who are authorised to represent the association
* The people in charge of the daily management of the non-profit organization or the foundation
* The founders of a foundation
* The natural persons or, when these persons have not yet been designated, the category of natural persons in whose main interest the non-profit organization or the foundation was formed or operates. This is mainly when the association is specifically aimed at funding a certain person or designated group of people
* Any other natural person exercising by other means the ultimate control over the non-profit organisation or foundation

The UBO register must be **kept updated each year** with the **effective beneficiaries** of the association. It can be accessed with the Belgian ID card of one of the administrators registered as such at the CBE. There is no limit date specified, but any change of beneficiaries must be registered **within one month** to the UBO register.

#### Associations tax

ASBLs/AISBLs with **more than € 25,000 in assets** are subject to an [annual tax](https://finances.belgium.be/fr/asbl/impots-tva/taxe-annuelle-asbl) of 0.17% of their declared assets value. If the ASBL's assets are less than or equal to € 25,000, it is not subject to the tax. It is, however, still required to fill a declaration and indicate that the assets do not exceed € 25,000.

The declaration must be filed **no later than March 31**. Each ASBL receives, in principle, an invitation from the Legal Security office to submit a declaration during the month of February.

#### Social report

Non-profit organisations that employ an average of 20 or more staff per year, including small non-profit organisations, must draw up a social balance sheet.

## Employment and contracting

AISBLs can contract workers, either as **independent workers** or **employee workers**.

Warning, a member of the AISBL being contracted as a worker (independent or employee) can often be seen as a conflict of interests. Such situations need to be extremely well and clearly formulated and written.

#### Employee workers

Contracting **employees** requires a large amount of [administrative procedures](http://vieassociative.be/sites/default/files/20150819-formalites-administratives-engager-travailleur.pdf) (FR), mainly register to different social security levels and contract an insurance against work damages. An employee contract can be full or part time, and with no time limit or with a certain time frame, for a certian kind of tasks or not. Part of employment boost measures, Belgium offers several kinds of helps to employers.

#### Independent workers

An AISBL can contract an independent worker without any regulation or inscription. However, in this case, all the burden of taxes, social securities and everything else is the responsability of the worker. It is therefore important that the worker shows their compliance to this. It is usually done by issuing an **invoice** where details over the worker's social security or tax inscription are given, which could allow the AISBL to check that the worker is indeed in order with their tax administration.
