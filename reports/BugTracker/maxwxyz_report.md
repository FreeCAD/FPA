## 2024-03-15
I've started my activity on 2024-02-12 and made myself familiar with the bug tracker system. From the beginning I've tried to closely keep up with new issues, checking their quality and classifying them.

My intention is to look at and categorize all issues and lable them either as **bug** (errors / failures in the current features) or **feature** (improvements and new features). All issues should be tagged with the corresponding workbench and topic specific tags will be applied (e.g. UI/UX, Units,...). 
Issues wich still need refinement, information from the author or other users are tagged with the corresponding `Missing: ...` tags. If necessary, relevant developers will be pinged. I try to reproduce all bugs if possible and check for already existing issues which are either related or a duplicate. Same logic will be applied when revisiting all existing issues.

### Current statistics this month:
|Metric|Count|
|:---|---:|
|**New** issues this month: | 219 |
|**Closed** issues this month: | 153 |
|Currently open issues in **total**: | 1,361|

Monthly issue metrics for February 2024: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/12972

All new issues this month were tagged and - where necessary - were followed up to ask for more information.
Additionally, around 55 old issues were revisited in the list, beginning with the oldest in the repository.
An issue metric workflow was added to the repository to automatically create issue related reports on metrics each month, which will be included in the monthly reports.

### Outlook
Next month I will start going in depth though the pile of all old issues, starting with the oldest ones and try figuring out if these are still relevant (try the issues in the weekly builds), if more info is needed, if newer duplicates / better described issues are present or if the issue needs more refinement.
The `Missing: ...` tags will be used to indicate if the issue is still in triage or ready and relevant.
On all the imported issues from the old bug tracker system the main issue will be to identify and ping the relevant people who were involved at the creation of the issue. I will try to replicate bugs and think through the old issues in detail if no other person is commenting.
In case of no replies or unclear issues, the issue will be marked for closing and closed after one month if there is no activity. This is only applicable for the old / imported issues for now.
**It would be nice if people could look out for them and comment, just search the issues for [`is:open is:issue sort:created-asc label:"Missing: feedback"`](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+sort%3Acreated-asc+label%3A%22Missing%3A+feedback%22)**

Depending of the amount of issues I have to see if I can list them all like the current issues above or if I report a summary (x issues closed because of y).

Additionally, we will manage a project board for the [**FreeCAD Day 2024 Complaint Session**](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/20), search for and add already existing issues which were mentioned (remarks from the discussion will be commented), create new issues for actionable mentions and keep track of the implementation status. The plan is to add all issues or create new one if not existing yet until next months report.


## 2024-04-15
The work on the bugtracker system continued, all new issues were triaged and labels were tagged accordingly. Relevant people (authors, developers) were pinged to follow up or ask for more information. There are no duplicates for new issues this month, if duplicates were created, they were closed and aditional feedback was added as comment to the original issue. 
All manually closed issues won't be mentioned as list including reason to close.

The old imported issues which were tagged with `Missing Feedback` between February and March 2024 were closed if there were no more feedback in one month. 

All actionable mentions from the FreeCAD Day 2024 Complaint Session (if specific enough) are now represented in the corresponding GitHub project board: [**FreeCAD Day 2024 Complaint Session**](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/20) 
The bug tracker system was searched for related issues to the complaints, feedback from the discussion transcript was added as comments and some mentiones were grouped if possible and related. For all mentions which were not present on GitHub, new issues were created and tagged. It is now on the developers to close as many as possible for a review on next years FreeCAD Day.

Here is the mapped table for the issues:

| 118 | For geometry that is small you still have edges showing in FreeCAD.

|Metric|Count|
|:---|---:|
|**New** issues this month: | 211 |

|Currently open issues in **total**: | 1,477 |

Monthly issue metrics for the last period: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/13465


### Outlook
Next month the focus will be again on going through the old issues, starting with the oldest ones (imported from Mantis).

Besides triaging them as usual and checking for relevance or reproducability in the current weekly builds, the attachments from the old Mantis bugtracker system will be manually copied to the imported issues on GitHub. 
Currently, there are 359 open issues on GitHub which were imported from the old system.
Please also watch out for the old issues tagged for feedback if they are still relevant:  [`is:open is:issue sort:created-asc label:"Missing: feedback"`](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+sort%3Acreated-asc+label%3A%22Missing%3A+feedback%22)** as otherwise they will be closed after one month.
If there is no more feedback for newly created issues, they will be closed after 1-2 weeks.


## 2024-05-15
This month, the bug tracking efforts continued with a focus on maintaining the repository's state. All new issues underwent a review to ensure reproducibility, relevance, and to check for any existing duplicates. Prompt tagging and follow-up actions were taken for each issue, including tagging related issues and/or developers in the comments for collaboration. 

This month, a notable increase in issues related to Qt6 compatibility and building from source could be observed. Additionally, some pull requests were merged which closed multiple issues at once. Notably, many pull requests addressed UI and icon-related issues, reflecting a concerted effort to enhance the user experience.

The amount of new and closed issues are at a consistent level with the last two periods, but the time taken to tag and respond to new issues was slightly reduced, indicating improved efficiency in the bug tracking process.


### Current statistics this month:
|Metric|Count|
|:---|---:|
|**New** issues this month: | 208 |
|**Closed** issues this month: | 166 |
|Currently open issues in **total**: | 1,600 |

Monthly issue metrics for the last period: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/14030


### Outlook
DWG Label and Project: a new label tag, `DWG` (Design Working Group), has been introduced to tag issues requiring input or a discussion from the Design Working Group, particularly those related to UI/UX. Old issues will also be retroactively tagged for relevance on this topic. A new project board was introduced to this topic and will be populated with relevant tasks. The board can be found here: https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/24

A new project board for ISO GPS / GD&T topics has been established, although new issues for this topic are yet to be created, they will be added here: https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/23

Issue Refinement: Issues that lack a clear problem description or present multiple solutions will be converted into discussions for further refinement, ensuring clarity and actionable solutions.

## 2024-06-15
This month, we observed an increased number of issue reports concerning the FreeCAD topological naming problem (TNP). This surge is likely due to more users testing and reporting back following the recent TNP fixes that were merged. Additionally, we encountered a significant number of poorly crafted issues, either duplicates of existing ones or help requests with specific problems that required sorting out and follow-up. Moreover, many old issues were closed due to a lack of further feedback from authors or developers, or because the issues could not be replicated, causing progress to stall. The oldest issue closed without any comment was from 2017, imported from the old bug tracker system.

- Tagging and Follow-Up: All new issues were promptly reviewed, tagged, and assigned to relevant developers or team members. Follow-up comments were added to gather more information or to suggest possible solutions.
- Topological Naming Problem (TNP) Reports: With the recent TNP fixes being merged, we saw an increase in related issue reports. Each report was tagged appropriately, and follow-up actions were taken to gather further information or confirm the issues.
- Poorly Crafted Issues: A significant portion of the new issues were duplicates or requests for help. These were managed by consolidating duplicates, providing assistance where necessary, and ensuring that each issue was properly categorized.

### Current statistics this month:
|Metric|Count|
|:---|---:|
|**New** issues this month: | 238 |
|**Closed** issues this month: | 207 |
|Currently open issues in **total**: | 1,713 |

Monthly issue metrics for the last period are currently not possible due to the failing GitHub action.


### Outlook
Continued Focus on Old Issues: The focus will remain on going through the old issues, starting with the oldest ones. These issues will be checked for relevance, reproducibility in the current weekly builds, and further information if needed.

Refinement of Poorly Crafted Issues: Efforts will continue to improve the quality of new issues by providing guidance on proper issue reporting and actively managing duplicates and help requests, converting issues which are not ready to discussion.

With the sheer amount of new issues beeing created, it could be discussed to implement a priority system for problems incl. tagging them by how difficult it is to solve them.

Everyone can help with triaging by looking for old issues tagged with "Missing: feedback" to determine their relevance. These will be closed after one month if no further feedback is provided.

## 2024-07-15
This month, we continued to see a high volume of issue reports related to the FreeCAD topological naming problem (TNP) fixes. Additionally, there was an uptick in issues concerning color and material implementations. 
All issues were diligently followed up and tagged accordingly. 
There was a rise in issues missing critical information, such as missing about info, steps to reproduce, or example files, which required additional effort to manage. These were managed by requesting additional details from the authors to ensure the issues were actionable. Also, an increase in issues related to color and material implementations was noted this period. There was also a notable rise in duplicate issues, especially regarding this issue: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/15102

### Changes relating to the upcoming 1.0 release
- Blocker Tag and Milestones: Issues deemed critical for the 1.0 release are tagged with a `blocker` tag and assigned the milestone `1.0`. All blocker issues are currently assigned to contributors. Issues with the milestone 1.0 but without the blocker tag are considered nice-to-have for the 1.0 release.
- Pull Requests: All PRs are now either tagged with the `1.0` or `Post 1.0` milestone. Only PRs with the 1.0 milestone will be merged before the release. This ensures a focus on critical fixes and necessary improvements for the upcoming release.

There are currently 32 unresolved issues with the `blocker` tag and the `1.0` milestone which need to be fixed with priority [`is:issue is:open label:Blocker milestone:1.0`](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ABlocker+milestone%3A1.0). Overall, there are 111 issues set for a 1.0 milestone but not considered a blocker for a release.
3 of the blocker issues already have a submitted PR which are not merged yet, overall there are currently 27 open PRs which are set for the 1.0 milestone.


### Current statistics this month:
|Metric|Count|
|:---|---:|
|**New** issues this month: | 218 |
|**Closed** issues this month: | 319 |
|Currently open issues in **total**: | 1,802 |

Monthly issue metrics for the last period: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/15426

### Outlook
Apart from triaging the bug tracker system, effort will be on the issues and PRs concerning the upcoming 1.0 release.
- Labeling and Prioritization: Continue labeling PRs with the 1.0 or Post 1.0 milestone. Ensure that relevant new issues are tagged appropriately for the 1.0 release and marked as blockers where necessary. Each blocker issue should have an assignee.
- Stricter PR Evaluation: Implement a stricter procedure for evaluating PRs. Only bug fixes for critical issues, 1.0 blockers, and regressions will be accepted for merging before the 1.0 release. We are already in a feature and UI freeze, and all future PRs will be given the post 1.0 milestone.

Everyone can help by checking new issues if they can be reproduced or if they are related to similar issues. If you can build FreeCAD yourself, you can test the open PRs and comment on them, or you could tackle the 1.0 tagged issues, especially the ones labeled as blocker for the next release.
