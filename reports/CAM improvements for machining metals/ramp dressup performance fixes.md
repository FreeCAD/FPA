I have completed sub-project 3 of the grant, "RampEntry dressup performance fixes"

## List major changes and respective pull requests.

The project had two deliverables:

- A model and corresponding ramped tool path that exhibits the performance problem
- A code change that fixes the performance problems on that model (and hopefully every other one as well!), while producing the same ramped tool path as before

Both deliverables are satisfied by [PR 21944](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21944)

## Tell us what the challenges were (if any).

I expected the performance problem to be resolved by a careful analysis of the running time of the algorithm as-implemented, and correction of any mistakes that made it non-linear running time. In fact, the bulk of the performance improvements went exactly like this, but I was still left with a slow algorithm that took a couple seconds to run instead of being largely instantaneous. I expected this based on prior experimentation and was prepared to do more extensive profiling, but I was surprised ultimately by the amount of rewriting required to resolve this problem (see the PR description for documentation of this process).

Additionally, I set out to make a purely computation performance improvement to the dressup -- no change in output. However, during my work, I discovered bugs in the existing implementation. Preserving these bugs (to make my changes easy to check -- no diff in output) would have been challenging, since some of these bugs were responsible for performance issues! I ultimately produced a single PR that integrated fixes for the bugs I discovered along side the performance improvements I set out to create. I documented all changes in ramping output, and justified where each one comes from, and why it is desirable. Again, see the PR description for details.

Finally, with all of this technical work in place, merging this PR (and other PRs for other sub-projects of the grant) was delayed because the CAM group put work on hold to create a roadmap and prioritize work on that roadmap. This prevented me from merging my work and completing the project for some time, but eventually we figured out a structure for our roadmap and I proposed roadmap epics that covered the work I'm doing for this grant. None of my PRs for this grant are blocked by this process any longer, and all of them have priority due to being a part of the roadmap.

## Tell us if you think the rest of the project should be reorganized based on what youâ€™ve learned, and why.

No. The 3 sub-projects I proposed are largely independent, and I have no reason to change their structure.

## Tell us if you are ready to continue working on the project as agreed.

Yes. Hopefully I will have another update for completing another project later today or tomorrow!
