I have completed sub-project 2 of the grant, "LeadInOut dressup fixes and improvements"

## List major changes and respective pull requests.

The project had two deliverables:

- Add a feature to switch which direction the arc (or tangent) entrance/exit comes from/to
- Add a feature to specify how far to arc, instead of always doing a quarter circle

Both deliverables are satisfied by FreeCAD/FreeCAD#22669.

In addition to these deliverables, this PR provided a number of other entrance/exit styles, as well as an overtravel feature.

## Tell us what the challenges were (if any).

After I proposed the grant (before it was even approved!), @tarman3 started implementing the backend for features I was proposing and other related features on the LeadInOut dressup. He was not prepared/willing to make the corresponding UI changes, however, and the pull request seemed unlikely to ever be merged with the UI broken. I decided my task would be to fix/build the UI and to negotiate the PR/review/merge process to see that both the deliverables I set out to achieve and also the other work he did for the LeadInOut dressup all got merged. This is the task I ultimately ended up doing. (I asked tarman if he wanted to join me on this grant and he said no.)

Similar to the ramp dressup performance work, this PR was put on hold while the CAM group decided how it wanted to use a roadmap and created that roadmap. I acquired additional work dealing with merge conflicts while this happened, but besides for that, work on this project went smoothly.

## Tell us if you think the rest of the project should be reorganized based on what youâ€™ve learned, and why.

No. The 3 sub-projects I proposed are largely independent, and I have no reason to change their structure.

## Tell us if you are ready to continue working on the project as agreed.

Yes. I have already merged the larger of 2 PRs for the last part of my grant, and I am working on the final PR. I should have a working draft within a week.
