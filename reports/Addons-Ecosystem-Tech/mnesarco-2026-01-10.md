## Research

### FreeCAD Python bindings

- Analysis of the current status of the FreeCAD python bindings vs the state of the art. Presented in Developer meeting with proposals to improve.
- Fix of signature bindings in .pyi based generator vs c++ signatures (only keywords support or not)
- Development of a draft for proper signature handling in C++ side of the generated bindings, CPython bindings and PyCXX bindings: https://github.com/mnesarco/marzpyb (Presented to @tritao and @kadet1090)
  - Compile time checked
  - Declarative
  - Two alternatives: Clausure based and Guard based
- Attempt to autogenerate binding docs from pyi file using griffe: Partial success but too many problems, brittle solution because:
  1. Not all binding are pyi based (we have also pybind11, PyCXX and direct CPython bindings not based on pyi)
  2. Current pyi compile time module structure is inconsistent with runtime module structure.

### Addons Module Loading

- Review and analysis of FreeCAD init sequence (Python side)
- Refactor of init scripts FreeCADInit.py, FreeCADGuiInit.py to make it modular and modern, there are more refactoring planned as this area has a lot of room for improvement.

### Automated Addon Quality Report (Technical metrics)

Created an automation to analyze all registered addons and generate a report including:
- Repository Info
- Bandit issues (High, Medium, Low) (Python code analysis)
- Dependencies analysis (pipreqs)
- Basic package.xml and init scripts inspections

The report is generated automatically on a monthly basis, or by demand.
