## Summary of Activities - OCCT Liaison - January 2026

### Update the project

The [OCCT Liaison
project](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/32/views/1?layout=table) has
received updates on various issues.

### Investigate [Issue #19403](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/19403)

In OCCT [issue #783](https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT/issues/783) has
been fixed and while checking whether the fix also works in FreeCAD I noticed
that indeed the crash is gone, but the reported action is still not possible.
This will need more investigation.

### Port FreeCAD to OCCT 8

The OCCT 8 API is significantly changing and because of that, lots of changes
are required in FreeCAD and Salome.  [Draft PR
#25502](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/25502) brings FreeCAD up-to-date with the new OCCT 8 API.

### Host for OpenCascade at the FreeCAD day and FOSDEM

On my invitation, Dmitrii joined on the FreeCAD day and on FOSDEM where he gave
a talk in the Open Source Hardware CAD/CAM room.  I acted as a host during
these days and had many very interesting discussions.
