## Summary of Activities - OCCT Liaison - July 2025

### Create a framework for working on issues

As reported last month, my focus for this month was mainly on a framework to
report OCCT issues.  I made a first step by creating a video that explains how
to minimize models for reporting to OCCT.  This is discussed in [this forum
topic](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=839428#p839428).  The [project
board](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/32/views/8) has been updated
accordingly with information on which state an issue can be:
- 1 Needs triage
- 2 Needs minimal model
- 3 Needs DRAW test
- 4 Needs to be submitted

### Update the project

The [OCCT Liaison
project](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/32/views/1?layout=table) has
received some updates on issues but not that much.  Last month I reported that
I'm running behind and that is again the case.  I will focus in August mostly
on OCCT issues that are also considered as regressions.

### DRAW Test Harness

The video I created makes use of
[#11654](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/11654).  I also worked on
creating DRAW test harnesses for those.

### Discussion on OCCT bug reporting and versions

In May I was waiting for progress from Adrian.  We agreed to talk about this,
but this hasn't happened yet.  I wanted to pick up on this last month but that
hasn't happened yet.

### Contact with Dmitrii/OCCT regarding Data Exchange

I'm ready to submit another issue to OCCT and will contact Dmitrii also
mentioning the work I did on reporting issues.

### Part Design / Part interaction

I was supposed to put this on an agenda of the developer meeting.  Now, I think
it may be better to ping Kacper about it personally.  I will do that in August.
