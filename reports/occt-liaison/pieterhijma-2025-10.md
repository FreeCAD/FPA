## Summary of Activities - OCCT Liaison - October 2025

### Update the project

The [OCCT Liaison
project](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/32/views/1?layout=table) has
received updates on issues.  There are still OCCT-related issues in the issue
tracker that are not in the project, but I'm close to having captured all
issues.

### Discussion on OCCT bug reporting and versions

I contacted Adrian last month, but I don't have a reply yet.  I will ping him
again.

### Verify an OCCT fix

OCCT has fixed issue [#15102](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/15102)
that I submitted last month.  I verified that this fix has also the expected
behavior in FreeCAD which it does.

### DRAW Test Harness

I focused on submitting a DRAW test harness for a crash in FreeCAD.  For this
one, it was challenging to find out what exactly was the problematic geometry,
but it has now been submitted to OCCT.

### Contact with OCCT on FOSDEM

I sent an email to OCCT inviting them to FOSDEM, the FreeCAD day, and the
hackathon.  I also introduced Brad regarding the FreeCAD Professional Network.
