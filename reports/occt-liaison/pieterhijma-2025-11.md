## Summary of Activities - OCCT Liaison - November 2025

### Update the project

The [OCCT Liaison
project](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/32/views/1?layout=table) has
received updates on issues.

### Investigate [Issue #24115](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/24115)

This is an issue from freckletonj trying to compute toolpaths with section.
There are also related issues.  This user also offered to help and I'm trying
to find a way to help each other with this.  A good step would be to have
freckletonj to use a FreeCAD with the latest OCCT in which the errors
freckletonj gets are less prevalent.  So, I'm helping freckletonj to compile
OCCT in a Discord thread.

### Investigate [Issue #25146](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/25146)

I'm investigating this issue together with Wandererfan.  It currently seems as
if fuzzy values in boolean operations are causing very high tolerances, but we
are still investigating.

### Adapting to OCCT IR / OCCT 8.0

FreeCAD doesn't compile against the latest OCCT and will not against the latest
8.0.  Created [an issue](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/25496) for
that and an [initial PR](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/25502) that I
use to compile FreeCAD with.

### Report on the forum

I answered a question on [achievements of the OCCT Liaison
project](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=859570#p859570) on the
forum.

### Reaching out to KiCad

I've reached out to Seth Hilbrand asking what OCCT-related issues KiCad is
dealing with.  He responded with a couple of issues and I'm interested to see
if there is overlap with issues in FreeCAD.
