## Summary of Activities - OCCT Liaison - September 2025

### Update the project

The [OCCT Liaison
project](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/32/views/1?layout=table) has
received extensive updates on issues.  Previous months I've mentioned each time
that I was running behind, but now I'm up-to-date.

Besides that, I focused mostly on OCCT issues with the regression label.

### Regressions

To prepare for release 1.2, the FreeCAD developers are trying to handle
regressions.

There are five issues that are both labeled regressions and OCCT in [FreeCAD's
issue
tracker](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22Type%3A%20Regression%22%20label%3A%223rd%20party%3A%20OCC%22).
I track those issues in the [For release
view](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/32/views/15) in the [OCCT
Liaision project](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/32).

One of those five issues is no longer in the list because it has been marked as
"Done" because the issue has been solved in OCCT 7.9.

Two of the other four issues are submitted to OCCT, one of which causes a crash.

One of the four issues, issue
[#20889](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/20889) is on Dmitrii's radar
and I provided brep files for Dmitrii for various OCCT versions.

The final issue awaits triage from Hyarion or the CAM team and may not be
OCCT-related.

### DRAW Test Harness

- [#15102](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/15102)

### Discussion on OCCT bug reporting and versions

I contacted Adrian, but I don't have a reply yet.
