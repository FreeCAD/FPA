## Summary of Activities - OCCT Liaison - August 2025

### Update the project

The [OCCT Liaison
project](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/32/views/1?layout=table) has
received some updates on issues but not that much.  Last month I reported that
I'm running behind and that is again the case.  Regarding issues, I mainly
focused on issues that are considered regressions and investigated them and
reacted to them.

In September I will also focus mostly on OCCT issues with the regression label.

### DRAW Test Harness

The video I created makes use of
[#11654](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/11654).  Last month I
started creating DRAW tests for it and that has now finished, see [this
comment](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/11654#issuecomment-3236928864)
and following.

I created issues in the OCCT repository:

- [#690](https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT/issues/690)
- [#691](https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT/issues/691)
- [#692](https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT/issues/692)
- [#693](https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT/issues/693)
- [#694](https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT/issues/694)

### Contact with Dmitrii/OCCT regarding Data Exchange

Last month I was going to contact Dmitrii and I have now done that since I had
[an issue](https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT/issues/689) with running
the latest OCCT regarding loading Date Exchange modules.  Dmitrii mentioned
that he wanted to redesign parts of the Data Exchange module loading, so my
impression is that OCCT is still developing this feature.

### Discussion on OCCT bug reporting and versions

In May I was waiting for progress from Adrian.  We agreed to talk about this,
but this hasn't happened yet.  I wanted to pick up on this last month but that
hasn't happened yet.  I will pick up on this in September.

### Part Design / Part interaction

I briefly talked with Kacper about this and this project is more a long-term
project that should first go through a FEP process.
