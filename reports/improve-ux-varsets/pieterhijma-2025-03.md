## Summary of Activities - VarSet User Experience - March 2025

This project has (finally) started at the end of this month, although I did
some preparations in January.  I wanted to start earlier, but I gave priority
to the OCCT Liaison work.

By the way, I noticed that I don't have an official contract for this project
as I have for my other projects.

### Update the project page

I've updated the [project page](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/30/views/1).

### Visibility icon for VarSet

This is technically not limited to VarSets, but I can try to fix this anyway.
I contributed to the discussion in [issue
#16816](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/16816).
Based on my suggestion there I created [PR
20573](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20573) as an alternative to
Hyarion's solution, but I came to the conclusion that this implementation isn't
satisfactory as well.  I will follow up next month.

### Units in the VarSet dialog

Units in the editor for the value are not shown properly as reported in [issue
#15557](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/15557).
I've worked on this issue, but haven't been able to make it work.
