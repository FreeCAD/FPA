## Summary of Activities - VarSet User Experience - June 2025

### Renaming properties

This month focused on renaming properties.  The following PR was moved from
draft, but it is still open.  All comments have been processed though.

- [#21976](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21976)

The following PRs have been merged, fixing a test, allowing enum values to be
entered, allowing expressions in the VarSet dialog.  I reported on this last
month and this was a challenging, but it works now.

- [#22833 (merged)](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/22833)

The following PR is a bug fix that is open but all comments have been
processed:

### Improving the Expression dialog wrt VarSets

I've also been working on improving the [expression dialog for
VarSets](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/17075).  This is almost
ready.

### Moving properties

Finally, I'm working on [refactoring
properties](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/17099) in particular on
how to move properties from one object to another.
