## Summary of Activities - Improve C++ API Documentation - June 2025

### Transactions

The documentation on transactions triggered a discussion on "self-documenting"
functions.  This is currently being discussed in the CQWG on Discord.

- [#21494 (open, draft)](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21494).

The discussion has not received consensus yet, I will ping the other members.

### DocumentObject

There is progress on documenting DocumentObject although it is not yet
complete.

### Under scrutiny on the forum

This particular project has received criticism from Werner Mayer who is of the
opinion that the cost of this project is too high compared to other projects.
The [forum thread](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=97317) has two
posts from Werner, the [latter
one](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=832268#p832268) mentions this
project explicitly.  I wrote [a
reaction](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=832954#p832954) in which I
argue that the cost of this project is not too high.
