### Translatable Text Reviewer (Posted 23 Jan 2025)

The texts shown to the user in FreeCAD through the UI are generally suffering of many grammatical problems: Different tenses/forms used in different contexts, or texts that are poorly written or sometimes difficult to understand. 

This is normal given that many programmers are not native English speakers, but since the English form is the base that fuels all other translations, most problems end up propagating into the translations as well. So we need to fix the English texts at the source.

The FPA is therefore seeking grant applicants to monitor, coordinate, normalize, and unify translatable UI strings.

Key responsibilities:

  *  Establish guidelines to orient developers when writing different kinds of texts: What form to use on buttons, what form to use in dialogs, etc
  *  Verify and fix grammatical errors in all of the FreeCAD texts. Reach to the developers when needed to make sure of the correct meaning
  *  Monitor and reply questions of translators on CrowdIn and on GitHub
  *  Follow-up when translators find problems in the source strings. Make pull requests when needed

The applicant should be a fluent (native level) English speaker, have excellent grammatical and writing skills, and be ready to work tightly with the community of developers and translators.

The FPA is offering a yearly grant of USD 5000, to be divided and scheduled according to a plan to be proposed by the applicant. It is expected that the applicant proposes a scheme that covers monitoring more or less during the whole year, but the work can also be done in more condensed work periods.

Position open until filled. Send resume and cover letter to fpa@freecad.org to apply.
