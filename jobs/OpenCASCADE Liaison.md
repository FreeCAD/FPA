### OpenCASCADE Liaison (Posted 23 Jan 2025)

Currently held by: Pieter Hijma (@pieterhijma)

The FPA is seeking grant applicants to coordinate bug reports and patches with the OpenCASCADE development team.

Key responsibilities:

   * Monitor the FreeCAD Issue tracker and forums for OCCT-related bugs
   * Test issues and develop DRAW-harness equivalents to the FreeCAD issue
   * Submit bugs upstream and coordinate responses with the OCCT team
   * Assist FreeCAD developers in creating Pull Requests to OCCT, assuming copyright and assigning it to the OpenCASCADE project as necessary.
   * Seek, find and maintain contacts within the OCCT development team, and help them and FreeCAD developers to communicate efficiently.

This is an ongoing grant of 500 USD per month, renewable yearly. Developers unfamiliar with the OCCT development process are welcome to apply: it is expected that in the first several months of this grant the grantee will develop familiarity with the DRAW harness and OCCT test and development process. Good familiarity with FreeCAD and the FreeCAD community is required.

Position open until filled. Send resume and cover letter to fpa@freecad.org to apply.
