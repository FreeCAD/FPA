## Original job posting

### Infrastructure Maintenance Leader (Posted 18 July 2025)

The FPA is seeking grant applicants to coordinate the maintenance of the FreeCAD project infrastructure.
FreeCAD's infrastructure is currently a set of individual "droplets" at DigitalOcean. Those droplets host services such as the website, forums, wiki, and addon cache. In addition, as the project continues to grow, additional infrastructure will become necessary: single-sign-on systems via LDAP, load balancing, additional forums servers, etc. The development, documentation, and ongoing maintenance of this continues to increase over time and coordination of the work and the volunteer team is necessary.

The Infrastructure Maintenance Leader (IML), compensated at 1000 EUR/month, will oversee the operation, documentation, and upgrades to this infrastructure. The IML will coordinate with the rest of the project to maximize service availability, to improve services as the project grows and its needs change, and to ensure that all services and service tasks are documented so that the work can be distributed throughout the team and handed off as needed. Finally, the IML will help FreeCAD to transition to more independent and/or self-hosted solutions when appropriate. Quarterly reports will be delivered describing the work completed over the preceding quarter and the plans for the next quarter.

The FPA estimates that this role will require approximately 5-10 hours per week of continuous maintenance and personnel coordination. The position will also entail occasional emergency response to handle outages that will require rapid resolution and high availability on the part of the IML.

This is a 1-year contract position with an option for renewal upon agreement between the contractor and the FPA at the end of that time.

Position open until filled. Send resume and cover letter to fpa@freecad.org to apply.
