# Addon Ecosystem Coordinator

## Original job posting

### Addon Ecosystem Coordinator (Posted 17 July 2025)

The FPA is seeking grant applicants to coordinate the FreeCAD Addon ecosystem.

Key responsibilities:

  *  Test each addon in the official FreeCAD-Addons repository for compatibility with the current release version of FreeCAD
  *  Score each addon against a rubric for functionality, documentation, integration into FreeCAD, and developer engagement
  *  Work with Addon developers to bring their addons into compatibility, or to transfer the work to another developer
  *  Onboard new Addon developers to the process of getting their addons included in the official repository (e.g. creation of package.xml metadata file, icon, etc.)
  *  Develop better documentation for the entire process of creating a FreeCAD Addon
  *  Work with FreeCAD developers to improve the Addon Manager user experience
  *  Help develop the Addon Manager

This is an ongoing grant of 500 USD per month, renewable yearly. It is expected that over the course of the first six months all existing Addons will receive a score according to a rubric developed as part of this grant. Once all Addons have received their initial evaluation, the grantee will work with developers by submitting issue reports on their project issue trackers, as well as developing documentation about the Addon development and distribution process. It is not required that the recipient be a developer themselves, nor that they become experts in any of the fields the Addons represent. All evaluations will be basic in nature (“Does the Addon launch?”, “Does the Addon crash FreeCAD?”, etc.).

Position open until filled. Send resume and cover letter to fpa@freecad.org to apply.
