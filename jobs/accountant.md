### Job offer: FPA accountant (Posted 10 July 2025)

#### Preamble

The [FreeCAD Project Association](https://fpa.freecad.org) (FPA) , an Internal Non-Profit Association (AISBL) seated in Brussels, Belgium, is seeking an accountant to help all year long with all the accounting tasks needed by the association. The FPA receives at the moment roughly 150 000 EUR/year in donations, most of them micro-donations from individuals of less than 10 EUR, made through internet platforms like PayPal or OpenCollective. The FPA spends that money through different programs, such as financing events where FreeCAD developers meet, sponsoring developers through grants (donations), and contracting services from developers and other people as to perform different activities that support the project. The FPA is subject to VAT in Belgium, and, as a support body to an open-source project, consider of uttermost importance to be extremely and totally transparent.

The accountant we seek should be fluent in English, as this is our common language around the project, and ideally know some French or Dutch to be able to help with Belgian documents (optional, see below). The accountant should also be ready to work with internet platforms, and able to handle and unify different CSV sources from these platforms. They should also be willing to work with Markdown, produce reports in open formats like HTML or Markdown, and use open-source accounting software. We are currently using gnuCash.

The FPA seeks mainly an accountant who is comfortable with open-source software, crowdfunding platforms and micro-donations, and is able to adapt to the FPA's full transparency practices. Ideally, the accountant would also be a registered accountant in Belgium and able to perform the additional Belgium-related tasks described below. However, we understand such a profile might be hard to find, and we will give the priority to the first part. In that case, FPA admins will carry out the Belgian parts.

The FPA is not necessarily seeking for an experienced accountant, but rather a flexible person ready to work or learn to work "the open-source way".

#### Estimated time commitment
