# Regression Bisect Specialist (First posted 1 September 2025)

This position is currently held by Chris Jones (@ipatch), beginning January 1 2026.

## Original Job Posting

The FPA is seeking applicants to help identify and document code regressions in FreeCAD.

Key responsibilities:

* Investigate regression reports from users, developers, and CI tools
* Use git bisect and related tools to identify the commit that introduced a regression
* Reproduce issues locally using scripts, FreeCAD builds, or custom testing environments
* Collaborate with module Maintainers and other developers to understand the context of the regression
* Open well-documented GitHub issues or improve existing issues summarizing the regression cause, offending commit, and relevant discussion
* Contribute to tooling or automation that speeds up regression identification
* Improve the Developer Handbook with guides and tutorials to help others learn the bisecting process

This role requires both technical persistence and emotional intelligence. Since regressions are often the result of well-meaning contributions, the grantee must approach the work with tact and respect—focusing on shared goals and not assigning blame. The ability to give clear, actionable feedback without alienating contributors is essential.

This is a six month trial program grant for 500 euros per month. On successful completion of this period, the program will be considered for an ongoing role. The selected applicant is expected to stay on top of new regression reports and build a backlog of bisected regressions, as well as mentor others to spread this skill throughout the developer community.

Position open until filled. Send resume and cover letter to fpa@freecad.org to apply.
