# FreeCAD Professional Network Proposal

# 1\. Background: What Problem Are We Trying to Solve?

The FreeCAD community is broad and vibrant but disproportionately composed of hobbyists, tinkerers, and open-source developers. While this is a strength, it also leaves a significant gap: FreeCAD lacks active participation by professionals, companies, and educators who rely on it to achieve their goals.

While professionals represent a majority of CAD/CAM/CAE users in general, they represent a minority of the FreeCAD community.

This absence is not hypothetical. Over the past year, the FPA has surfaced concerns around:

1. Donor program stagnation. Bias toward individual one-time donations  
2. Lack of professional participation in working groups (e.g. DWG, CQWG, CWG)  
3. An unclear roadmap process disconnected from real-world use cases  
4. Minimal feedback loops from companies using FreeCAD in production  
5. Low engagement with academic researchers, educators, institutions  
6. Code quality and stability issues

The release of version 1.0 was a signal that we believe FreeCAD is ready for wider commercial adoption.  And yet, we have no structured way to connect with FreeCAD Professionals and engage them in the community productively.

# 2\. Diagnosis: Why This Gap Exists

The current community skews toward volunteer contributors, self-taught users, and open-source advocates. There are historical reasons for this and they largely stem from FreeCAD’s FOSS roots.  The project was, and is, organized to engage effectively with these people.  People from these groups are highly engaged in forums, GitHub, and community spaces. 

Professionals, on the other hand, have different needs and generally engage differently.  This table highlights a few of the distinct differences:

| Hobbyist / Individual | Professional |
| ----- | ----- |
| Less concerned about Intellectual Property. High value for sharing. | More concerned about IP.  Unwilling or unable to share models publicly. |
| Often satisfied with work-around solutions | Need repeatable and stable solutions |
| Engage on the forum frequently,  consistently and for social reasons. | Contribute to public discussions rarely and only when necessary. |
| Self-taught | Seek training, certification. |
| Willing to run bleeding-edge software | Prefer stable releases |
| Represent their own interests | Represent an organization’s interests |
| Work independently. | Work collaboratively |
| Principled | Pragmatic |
| Can often wait for a solution | Will move to alternative solutions quickly. |
| Very concerned about individual privacy | Very concerned about public image |
| Donate their own money | Donate corporate money |

In short, the current community organization is a poor fit for professional engagement.  

# 3\. Opportunity: What Signals Are We Seeing?

FreeCAD Professionals exist—they're just disconnected. Signals include:

1. Regular inquiries to FPA and Ondsel from companies asking for support, training, or roadmap information  
2. Thriving communities like LinkedIn FreeCAD group and Facebook   
3. High interest in Ondsel’s business-facing content and services  
4. Success of forks like AstoCAD, LS3, Ondsel.  
5. Numerous YouTube channels, consultants, and contractors working semi-independently

Some signals are also notably absent, especially when comparing FreeCAD to other projects like Blender and KiCAD:

1. Books and paid tutorials (coursera) are relatively rare  
2. Nobody offering certification  
3. Nobody offering paid support  
4. Low engagement in education  
5. Sponsorship offers are rare and small

These scattered signals indicate unmet need. There is latent value here, both financial and strategic, that we’re not capturing.

# 4\. Proposed Solution: Launch the FreeCAD Professional Network

First, it’s important to clarify that this proposal is talking about more than *users.* This initiative is proposing that the community of professionals also includes developers, educators, content-creators, manufacturers, and other organizations. The network would be open to anyone or any organization that has a commercial/financial interest in FreeCAD’s long-term viability.

A professional network would be the first step in engaging them in the community in productive and mutually beneficial ways.  Specifically the program will:

## Identify & Organize

1. Create a registry of professionals, companies, creators,  and educators who use FreeCAD.   
2. Identify manufacturers and service providers in adjacent sectors  
3. Identify educators and researchers  
4. Maintain a list of endorsed trainers, integrators, and consultants, support professionals

## Communicate

1. Publish a quarterly newsletter with project updates, case studies, and roadmap highlights  
2. Develop blog content that highlights corporate engagement  
3. Serve as a go-between.  Let individuals and orgs preserve privacy and still make legitimate contacts

## Learn From

1. Run an annual or semiannual summit for professionals  (online or real world)  
2. Solicit participation in working groups with professional perspectives  
3. Contribute to a multi-year roadmap of priorities.

## Facilitate Contribution

1. Seek ‘lighthouse projects’ to demonstrate capabilities and address missing functionality  
2. Facilitate contact between professionals and FreeCAD developers  
3. Coordinate corporate code contributions.  
4. Develop a donor program tailored to professional supporters

# 5\. Implementation: One-Time Project Grant

We propose that the FPA fund the initial establishment of this program through a one-time project grant of approximately $10,000.

1. The funds will be awarded to a single grantee responsible for launching the project.  
2. This grantee will report directly to the FPA board.  
3. The grant period will cover a 3–6 month window to produce defined deliverables

## Deliverables:

1. Professional registry / CRM system (preferably open source)  
2. Mailing list/newsletter platform (1-2 newsletters)  
3. Updated donor program targeting professionals  
4. Draft policies for boundaries and expectations (e.g., input vs. influence)  
5. Initial outreach effort to recruit professionals  
6. Public report summarizing membership, goals, infrastructure, and next steps

# 6\. What This Unlocks

1. Sustainable growth by making FreeCAD more usable and visible in professional contexts  
2. Stronger roadmap alignment with real-world demands  
3. Increased revenue through donor and sponsorship programs  
4. Higher quality feedback  
5. Better credibility with institutions, educators, and industry

# 7\. Summary

This proposal aims to fill the most important missing link in FreeCAD’s long-term sustainability: direct engagement with the professionals who rely on it. By treating this as a standalone project with dedicated funding, we give it the autonomy and focus needed to succeed. We strongly recommend the FPA approve this proposal and begin identifying a candidate to lead the effort.
