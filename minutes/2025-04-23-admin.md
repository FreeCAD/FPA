3. **Discussion Points:**

* **Donor Relations:**  A brief discussion initiated regarding improving donor relations, specifically thanking donors and potentially sending letters for larger donations. The main discussion was tabled until Joe (Obelisk) could attend.

* **Microsoft Laptop Donation for ARM Compilation:** Microsoft is donating a laptop for FreeCAD ARM compilation and providing technical support.  GitHub now provides ARM runners. The main sticking point is compiling Calculix for ARM due to Fortran compiler issues.

* **NLNet Grant Application:** Pieter provided a status update, stating that he hasn't heard back from NLNet yet.

* **USD/EUR Exchange Rate Fluctuations:** Discussion about the fluctuating USD/EUR exchange rate impacting payments.  Suggestion to list both USD and EUR amounts in future contracts.

* **Reqrefusion's Peer Learning Idea:**  Third Speaker is continuing research on this topic.

* **Developer Funding vs. Full-Time Hire:**  Previously decided this was moot as there were no plans for a full-time hire.

* **North American Meetup:** Confirmed for August 8th-10th (Friday-Sunday) in Springfield, Illinois. Main Speaker will be in Chicago the week before and available on the 7th.  Discussion about a blog post announcement and travel funding requests.

* **Direct Approach to Company Donations:** Discussion on increasing corporate donations.  Third Speaker suggested leveraging the FreeCAD website's high traffic for advertising/sponsorship.  Debate on appropriate sponsorship levels and the need for a comprehensive corporate relations strategy. Main Speaker will draft a proposal.

* **CAD Working Group Bounties Budget:** A â‚¬5,000 budget with a clawback clause for unclaimed bounties after one year is up for vote and likely to pass.

* **2025 Grant Program & Google Summer of Code:**  The 2025 grant program deadline is June 1st, with one submission received already.  GSOC mentor reviewing deadline is approaching.  Discussion about the number of proposals and mentors, with two proposals considered strong. Clarification that Google pays students directly, and mentors primarily provide guidance and support. Discussion about managing expectations for ambitious GSOC proposals. Guidance is for mentors to focus on helping onboard the student: actually achieving all stated goals is not of primary importance. Mentors should meet weekly (or more) with students.

* **Public Telemetry Results:**  Telemetry results are now publicly available at freecad.org/telemetry.php, updating weekly.  Suggestions for adding a user counter and promoting the telemetry feature.

* **Long-Term Roadmap and FreeCAD Enhancement Process:**  Discussion about the roadmap and incorporating reverse engineering tools, specifically for point cloud processing.  This will be discussed further in the next developer meeting.

* **Ongoing Votes and Payments:** Sticker payment issue resolved. CWG bounty program vote in progress.

* **Developer Forum:**  Testing a Flarum forum with GitHub single sign-on.  Discussion about migrating the developer forum and potentially other forums.  Considering whether to initially lock the forum to prevent bot activity.  Discussion about reorganizing the existing forum and separating developer, support, and tutorial discussions.
