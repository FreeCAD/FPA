# 2024 Annual report and 2025 plans

This document contains a report of the 2024 activities of the FreeCAD Project Association (FPA), as well as a plan for 2025.

### Foreword

2024 was a very active year for the FPA. Founded in late 2021, 2024 was the FPA's third full year of activity. For the first two years of the organization's existence, developing strategies for spending the donations we were receiving in a responsible and useful manner was a key area for growth (we realized how hard it actually is to spend money!). In 2025, with the re-launch of the FPA Development Fund grant program and the creation of several ongoing support positions, spending is finally on track, roughly matching the donations received in the previous year. This spending not only benefited the direct recipients of the funds, but much of it was directed towards projects that benefited *all* developers, paid and volunteer alike.

FreeCAD is a project by users, for users. The reason it exists and develops is because users take part in its development. It is part of our mission at the FPA to keep that process healthy and enjoyable, and for users to always feel it is *their* tool.

Paid development also brings in new people, new ideas, a new development pace, and exciting new perspectives. This is something everyone in the project is learning to work with, and the FPA endeavors to use its fund in ways that ultimately benefit everyone who uses FreeCAD.

The race to finish and release version 1.0 of FreeCAD was a hectic one, consuming developers' time for most of the past year. The FreeCAD community processed, reviewed, and merged an huge number of contributions. Everyone sought to make the release as perfect and powerful as possible, while still actually getting to the finish line, and making FreeCAD 1.0 a reality. The FPA contributed by funding grants in several key areas (such as mitigation of the topological naming problem), and creating support positions such as a paid "bug triager" to help manage the large volume of bug reports.

For next year, the FreeCAD development team wants to take a slower pace, and concentrate on solidifying everything, refactoring, refining development processes, and keeping FreeCAD as the trustable tool we have all come to love. The FPA will support this through funding in four key focus areas outlined later in this report.

Thanks to everybody who has helped build what FreeCAD is today: the most complete and powerful Free, Open-Source 3D CAD program available.

## 2024 report

### Version 1.0

The major achievement of 2024 is without a doubt the release of FreeCAD version 1.0. It took huge efforts from the whole community, large parts of new code and functionality were built, hundreds of bugs were fixed during an extended, six-months long feature freeze, and the reception to it is overwhelmingly positive.

Although this was vastly a whole community effort, the FPA is proud to report it has done its part to help this effort, by pushing and offering sponsoring where it was needed, and help problems such as toponaming resolution or UI issues to reach a solution. See the grants section below for more details, and see the [official announcement](https://blog.freecad.org/2024/11/19/freecad-version-1-0-released/) for more details about version 1.0.

### FPA top 5

These are the five priority topics the FPA had decided to attack in 2024. Although of course none of them can be called "done", as nothing is ever really "done" in the Free and Open-Source world, we are proud to report that all have advanced significantly:

* **Resolution of the Toponaming issue**: The work originally started by developer [Realthunder](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD) has been merge into FreeCAD, thanks first to a large organizing effort put in place by our friends at Ondsel, then by a continuous effort led and sponsored by the FPA to finish the work, test everything and make sure everything works. Although that does not means all the problems are gone, FreeCAD now has a solid solution in place. Developers should now be able to use it to address specific remaining toponaming problems that are still encountered.

* **Having a default Assembly workbench**: Even if FreeCAD could already count on several very good assembly add-ons, We all thought FreeCAD needed a default, built-in one with a dedicated 3D constraints solver. Again thanks mainly to Ondsel who joined the needed resources and people, FreeCAD now has such a solver, and a default, included assembly workbench that uses it. The role of the FPA here has only started, as we continue to fund initiatives to shape up this assembly workbench.

* **Working on better accessibility and UX**: The FPA has been active in setting up a Design Working Group, funding that group to upgrade their knowledge of UI questions, and starting to participate and write about UI. The idea here is no to try to "solve" anything, as we understood such thing does not exist, but rather to get everybody who contributes to FreeCAD to know about common guidelines and use them. Thanks to that effort, we have already seen a tremendous bettering in the FreeCAD UI. The work needs to continue, of course!

* **Having a FreeCAD-wide Materials system**: An integrated materials system, that is used throughout FreeCAD, by all the different workbenches, and that could handle all different use cases (physical properties, aspect properties or even rendering properties) is now a reality. Although this has been a community effort, and more precisely a one-man show thanks to the incredible effort of developer [Dave](https://www.davesrocketshop.com/), the FPA helped giving his work the attention of other developers and making it into the FreeCAD code as smooth as possible.

* **Better documentation**: The FPA has pursued different efforts to make the documentation better, by exploring different forms like the [developers handbook](https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/), giving grants to people to work on the documentation, or upgrading the [FreeCAD manual](https://wiki.freecad.org/Manual) for version 1.0. It has also explored different options to make our wiki documentation better and easier to translate and keep in sync with FreeCAD versions. This is of course an ongoing work, much more needs to be done, but we are on the good track!

### Developer grants

TBD

### FreeCAD development ecosystem

The FPA has put many efforts into bettering the general ecosystem, tools and environment for developers. Part of the job of the FPA is to support the wider community of people who contribute to FreeCAD, not only by paying grants to developers, but also by putting things in place that help all contributors, paid or not paid, to do their job better, and, even more important, to have fun while doing it. We all work on FreeCAD mainly because it is enjoyable, and at the FPA we want to make sure this continues and gets even better. To that aim, we started or continued different initiatives:

* **Bug triage maintainer**: The FPA now funds a bug triage maintainer, [Max](https://forum.freecad.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=56782), who is doing an incredible job in keeping the issues list active, clean, and making sure all submitted problems get the needed attention. There is now literally a "before Max" and "after Max" at FreeCAD.

* **Release maintainer**: The FPA continued funding and extended the role of [Adrian](https://forum.freecad.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=19302) as a release manager. Adrian is now taking care of all the packages and installers on all platforms, making sure FreeCAD works everywhere, and is also taking care of bugfix releases (these minor releases that are done from time to time after main releases, to fix the most annoying bugs).

* **Working on the forum and community guidelines**: As the FreeCAD community grows, come the community problems. The FreeCAD forum and other places where FreeCAD community members gather, sometimes suffer from members not behaving the friendly way we would all love to see always. This has made some potential new members avoid the forum because they do not see it as a safe or friendly enough place. Although this is a delicate question where there is no magical solution, we are working and determined to keep working on bettering the situation. Among other things, we have worked and bettered the [community guidelines](https://www.freecad.org/codeofconduct.php), made it easier for people to find who to talk to in case of problems, and are trying to get more forum moderators and help alleviate the load on the shoulders of the few heroes who volunteer to do that job.

### Conferences and meetings

### Financial report

#### tl;dr

The FPA is in an even stronger financial position than it was a year ago.  As of 2024-12-31, we have over €200,000 in assets and only a small debt of €2,000 for quarterly VAT charges (which was retired in early January 2025). Donations were almost double 2023, while spending increased by almost 400%.

As noted in last year's report, at the end of 2024 we wrote off as unrecoverable approximately €4,500 in donations held by BountySource due to the bankruptcy of its parent.

#### Financial goals for 2025:

* hire a bookkeeper/accountant
* grow reserve accounts to maintain a level of 20% of assets
* improve tracking of spending against budget
* improve payables handling

### FPA membership changes

In 2024, the [FPA roster](https://fpa.freecad.org/handbook/people/roster.html) has seen a few changes: [obelisk79](https://forum.freecad.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=36480) and [oursland](https://forum.freecad.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=57910) have joined the team of members, while the current administrators team has been reconducted for another period of 2 years. In total, [54 proposals]() **(TODO - add link to updated decisions.md)** have been approved by the FPA members in 2024.

## 2025 plan

TBD - Intro

### FPA top 4

For 2025 the FPA has identified four key focus areas that we particularly encourage developers to focus their efforts on, and that will be prioritized for grant funding.

#### 1. FreeCAD’s position within the larger FOSS ecosystem

FreeCAD depends on many other Free, Open Source Software (FOSS) packages. Additionally, FreeCAD's users often use FreeCAD in conjunction with other FOSS tools. The FPA
would like to improve FreeCAD's relationships with these packages by directly supporting development, meetups, and other collaborative efforts. For example, FreeCAD is
currently dependent on packages such as OpenCASCADE, Coin3D, and Qt: FPA funding can be used to develop bug fixes and features for these projects. FreeCAD users
often work with other packages such as KiCAD and OpenFOAM, and development of improved interoperability through Addons or directly in FreeCAD can also be supported by
FPA funding. These lists of software are by no means exhaustive, and development work on other related projecs is also eligible for support. In addition to direct
development, it is often beneficial to find ways to directly interact with the development teams of these other related projects, so FPA funding can be used to support
things such as meetups, conferences, dedicated online gathering places, etc.

#### 2. Developer experience and effectiveness

Improving the development experience and developer effectiveness is critical to the long-term health and stability of the project. There are many different facets to this
focus area, but broadly it can be broken down into several main components:

1. Improve onboarding
   1. Documentation
   2. Mentorship
2. Incentivize development in key areas
   1. Strategic features as identified by various working groups (e.g. the Design Working Group and CAD Working Group)
   2. Testing
3. Improve code quality and readability
   1. Adding tests (unit, regression, integration, etc.)
   2. Refactoring
   3. Modernizing
   4. More human testing of pull requests
   5. Better separation of business logic from UI
4. Keep merge process lean, fast, and predictable

The FPA will prioritize funding of grants that fit into one of these areas, and will work with Maintainers and Developers to encourage focus on these targets across the
broader development community.

#### 3. User Experience

User experience is common pain-point in FOSS, and in FreeCAD in particular. Over the many years of its development many different individuals have worked on parts of the
overall user experience, but only recently has a dedicated group formed to focus on the unification of these disparate pieces of the FreeCAD ecosystem. "User experience"
encompasses more than use the user interface of the software itself, and the FPA will focus on improving many different aspects in the coming year:

1. Pre-software experience (forums, website, social media)
2. Bug reporting and resolution
3. UI
4. Standard workflows
5. Documentation
6. Typical CAD workflows / CAD advisory group
7. Better support of multi-document assemblies
8. Support of collaborative document creation
9. Training/Certification

#### 4. Standards compliance

To make FreeCAD more useful in professional contexts, standards compliance is critical, and the FPA continues to foster development in this area, including by purchasing the
relevant standards and stewarding developer access to them. These include particular focus on Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) and Industry Foundation Classes (IFC),
but can extend to other important standards as identified by relevant working groups such as the CAD Working Group.
