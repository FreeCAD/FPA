# FPA 2025 yearly report

This document contains a report of the 2024 activities of the FPA, as well as a plan for 2025.

### Foreword

2024 has been a very active year for the FPA. This is our third full year in activity, and after two years during which we realized how hard it actually is to spend money and tried to set up solutions for that problem, we all feel now it is starting to work and bear fruits. We spent a lot more money this year, and we spent it the way we wanted, mainly by funding developers and development of course, but also in funding things that benefit all developers, those who are paid as well as those who work on FreeCAD voluntarily.

FreeCAD is a project by users, for users. The reason it exists and develops is because users take part in its development. It is part of our mission at the FPA to keep that healthy and enjoyable and users to always feel it is their tool.

Paid development also brings in new people, new ideas, and also a new development pace, and exciting new perspectives. This is something we are learning to work with, and that we want to always benefit everybody.

The race to finish and release version 1.0 of FreeCAD has been a hectic one. It took most of the past year. The FreeCAD community processed, reviewed and merged an absurd quantity of contributions. We all wanted it to be as perfect and powerful as possible.

For next year, we want to take a slower pace, and concentrate on solidifying everything, refactoring, refining our processes, and keeping FreeCAD as the trustable tool we have all come to love.

Thanks to everybody who has helped build what FreeCAD is today, be it a little or much.

## 2024 report

### Version 1.0

The major achievement of 2024 is without a doubt the release of FreeCAD version 1.0. It took huge efforts from the whole community, large parts of new code and functionality were built, hundreds of bugs were fixed during an extended, six-months long feature freeze, and the reception to it is overwhelmingly positive.

Although this was vastly a whole community effort, the FPA is proud to report it has done its part to help this effort, by pushing and offering sponsoring where it was needed, and help problems such as toponaming resolution or UI issues to reach a solution. See the grants section below for more details, and see the [official announcement](https://blog.freecad.org/2024/11/19/freecad-version-1-0-released/) for more details about version 1.0.

### FPA top 5

These are the five priority topics the FPA had decided to attack in 2024. Although of course none of them can be called "done", as nothing is ever really "done" in the Free and Open-Source world, we are proud to report that all have advanced significantly:

* **Resolution of the Toponaming issue**: The work originally started by developer [Realthunder](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD) has been merge into FreeCAD, thanks first to a large organizing effort put in place by our friends at Ondsel, then by a continuous effort led and sponsored by the FPA to finish the work, test everything and make sure everything works. Although that does not means all the problems are gone, FreeCAD now has a solid solution in place. Developers should now be able to use it to address specific remaining toponaming problems that are still encountered.

* **Having a default Assembly workbench**: Even if FreeCAD could already count on several very good assembly add-ons, We all thought FreeCAD needed a default, built-in one with a dedicated 3D constraints solver. Again thanks mainly to Ondsel who joined the needed resources and people, FreeCAD now has such a solver, and a default, included assembly workbench that uses it. The role of the FPA here has only started, as we continue to fund initiatives to shape up this assembly workbench.

* **Working on better accessibility and UX**: The FPA has been active in setting up a Design Working Group, funding that group to upgrade their knowledge of UI questions, and starting to participate and write about UI. The idea here is no to try to "solve" anything, as we understood such thing does not exist, but rather to get everybody who contributes to FreeCAD to know about common guidelines and use them. Thanks to that effort, we have already seen a tremendous bettering in the FreeCAD UI. The work needs to continue, of course!

* **Having a FreeCAD-wide Materials system**: An integrated materials system, that is used throughout FreeCAD, by all the different workbenches, and that could handle all different use cases (physical properties, aspect properties or even rendering properties) is now a reality. Although this has been a community effort, and more precisely a one-man show thanks to the incredible effort of developer [Dave](https://www.davesrocketshop.com/), the FPA helped giving his work the attention of other developers and making it into the FreeCAD code as smooth as possible.

* **Better documentation**: The FPA has pursued different efforts to make the documentation better, by exploring different forms like the [developers handbook](https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/), giving grants to people to work on the documentation, or upgrading the [FreeCAD manual](https://wiki.freecad.org/Manual) for version 1.0. It has also explored different options to make our wiki documentation better and easier to translate and keep in sync with FreeCAD versions. This is of course an ongoing work, much more needs to be done, but we are on the good track!

### Developer grants

### FreeCAD development ecosystem

The FPA has put many efforts into bettering the general ecosystem, tools and environment for developers. Part of the job of the FPA is to support the wider community of people who contribute to FreeCAD, not only by paying grants to developers, but also by putting things in place that help all contributors, paid or not paid, to do their job better, and, even more important, to have fun while doing it. We all work on FreeCAD mainly because it is enjoyable, and at the FPA we want to make sure this continues and gets even better. To that aim, we started or continued different initiatives:

* **Bug triage maintainer**: The FPA now funds a bug triage maintainer, [Max](https://forum.freecad.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=56782), who is doing an incredible job in keeping the issues list active, clean, and making sure all submitted problems get the needed attention. There is now literally a "before Max" and "after Max" at FreeCAD.

* **Release maintainer**: The FPA continued funding and extended the role of [Adrian](https://forum.freecad.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=19302) as a release manager. Adrian is now taking care of all the packages and installers on all platforms, making sure FreeCAD works everywhere, and is also taking care of bugfix releases (these minor releases that are done from time to time after main releases, to fix the most annoying bugs).

* **Working on the forum and community guidelines**: As the FreeCAD community grows, come the community problems. The FreeCAD forum and other places where FreeCAD community members gather, sometimes suffer from members not behaving the friendly way we would all love to see always. This has made some potential new members avoid the forum because they do not see it as a safe or friendly enough place. Although this is a delicate question where there is no magical solution, we are working and determined to keep working on bettering the situation. Among other things, we have worked and bettered the [community guidelines](https://www.freecad.org/codeofconduct.php), made it easier for people to find who to talk to in case of problems, and are trying to get more forum moderators and help alleviate the load on the shoulders of the few heroes who volunteer to do that job.

### FPA membership changes

In 2024, the [FPA roster](https://fpa.freecad.org/handbook/people/roster.html) has seen a few changes: [obelisk79](https://forum.freecad.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=36480) and [oursland](https://forum.freecad.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=57910) have joined the team of members, while the current administrators team has been reconducted for another period of 2 years.
